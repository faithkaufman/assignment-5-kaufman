        Act One, "Some Like It Not on the Neck." To begin, I should say, throughout this hour we're going to be talking about subject matter that can be difficult to discuss with children. So if you've got kids listening, that's something to consider. Also, in this next story, as Ira says, we will be acknowledging the existence of sex and talking a lot about our reluctance to speak of its existence.
        </p>

        <p>
        OK, let's start with the beginning. One way a lot of kids learn about the birds and bees is from each other. A couple weeks ago, a seven-year-old named Moxie told me a friend of hers, this kid, Aaron, said something to her that bothered her on the bus. He said, if you drew a picture of a baby on a piece of paper and put it in her belly, that would make a baby.
        </p>

        <p>
        Moxie knew this was incorrect. That's why it bothered her. So a week later at the playground across the street from her house, she sat Aaron down.
        </p>

        <cite>Moxie</cite>
        <p>The situation about the paper not working thing.</p>

        <cite>Aaron</cite>
        <p>What's that means?</p>

        <cite>Moxie</cite>
        <p>On the bus a few days ago, you talked about paper and body and about a baby--</p>

        <cite>Aaron</cite>
        <p>Oh, right, right, right, right.</p>

        <cite>Moxie</cite>
        <p>That was a silly plan.</p>

        <cite>Aaron</cite>
        <p>I'm sure it's going to work, but I don't know.</p>

        <cite>Moxie</cite>
        <p>I'm not sure because the baby can't survive, you see? I'm just saying.</p>

        <cite>Aaron</cite>
        <p>Sorry.</p>

        <cite>Moxie</cite>
        <p>You need to make a sperm. And the sperm somehow has to get into my body. And that's how it works.</p>

        <cite>Aaron</cite>
        <p>I did not know that.</p>

        <cite>Moxie</cite>
        <p>Well, now you do.</p>

        <cite>Aaron</cite>
        <p>Sorry.</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>When it comes to sex, a lot of us learn the wrong thing first and the right thing later. You learn through a series of corrections. You start to find out that half the things your brother told you were not right, that that scene in the movie is not realistic, that Sofia de Santos was lying when she says she did that thing, because that thing is not possible.</p>

        <p>That's basically our system. You learn things wrong, test them out, and hopefully get the real story from someone named Moxie. This begins on the playground and just continues all the way until you actually start having sex, and all the weird information that was not corrected begins to matter.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>What were you hoping they were going to cover?</p>

        <cite>Deondre</cite>
        <p>I hope they cover everything.</p>

        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>Deondre is in a classroom at Buffalo State with about 50 other people, mostly men, mostly his fraternity brothers. Here's here for some sex ed.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Deondre</cite>
        <p>I feel like some stuff people don't know.</p>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>What don't you know?</p>

        <cite>Deondre</cite>
        <p>I don't know. That's a good question, you know.</p>

        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>This is a voluntary workshop about sexual assault and consent, on a Monday night. You'd think this event might not win out over, say, hitting up the Jamba Juice or staring at your van Gogh poster.</p>

        <p>But this room is packed. The students are wide awake. Knees are bouncing. Hands are shooting up in the air.</p>

        <p>The instructor, Paula Madrigal, is talking about the importance of consent.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Paula Madrigal</cite>
        <p>So consent is a verbal and enthusiastic "yes," OK? Why is it enthusiastic?</p>

        <cite>Student 1</cite>
        <p>Because you actually want to do it.</p>

        <cite>Paula Madrigal</cite>
        <p>Exactly. You want to do it. And sex should be fun, right?</p>

        <cite>Student 2</cite>
        <p>Yeah.</p>

        <cite>Paula Madrigal</cite>
        <p>Yeah. I hope so.</p>
      </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>This kind of workshop was repeated in classrooms all across campus here and throughout the country in the last year. College administrators are panicked about sexual assault, as they should be. So they're turning to this kind of education as the answer.</p>

        <p>Instead of mostly focusing on protecting women-- things like rape whistles or travel with a buddy programs-- they also want to teach men actual sentences to say. Do you like this? Can I kiss you?</p>

        <p>But the students here are struggling with the basic premise. They have to learn to speak in this new way because if you don't, you're a rapist? Because it's just more virtuous? They have questions right from the start.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Paula Madrigal</cite>
        <p>It's a continuous process of checking up or checking in, either/or. What does that mean?</p>

        <cite>Student 2</cite>
        <p>You keep asking her? That's weird.</p>

        <cite>Student 3</cite>
        <p>That kind of messes up the mood. If she says yes-- I'm not trying to be funny-- but if she says yes, and then she keeps saying, yeah, I got to be like, hey, you sure? Are you really sure? Like, you're about to do this?</p>

        <cite>Student 4</cite>
        <p>Every 10 minutes.</p>

        <cite>Student 3</cite>
        <p>I'm almost there. I'm about to go to the drawer to get the protection. No, no. You're right. You're right. You're right.</p>

        <cite>Student 2</cite>
        <p>And you're like, no.</p>

        <cite>Student 3</cite>
        <p>Obviously, I'm going to stop. But the reaffirmation of "yes" over and over again. That kind of would mess up the mood. So I feel like-- should there be a number of times that you should-- you know?</p>

        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>He presses them on this-- two, three, seven? But that guy is overtaken by his fraternity brothers, who also have urgent questions. Does body language count as consent? What if she said yes before you got into the room when you were both sober, like, in a message on Twitter or something? How many beers is too much to have consent? Again, please offer a number.</p>

       <section class="dialogue">
       <cite>Student 5</cite>
        <p>You ever heard the term alcohol is liquid courage? What if it's in the sense where it's like, you are probably nervous, and you don't want to be nervous around her. So that gives you-- that's your liquid courage. I am not going to be shaky when she come over, you feel me? So you're not using it to get a "yes."</p>
      </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>The next guy over interrupts. What if both parties are drunk? And then across the room-- does the girl need to ask for consent? Another student-- OK, what if we've been together for a year?</p>

        <p>Paula Madrigal replies, you always need consent, even if you're a woman, even if you're a man sleeping with men, even if you're in a relationship, even if you have sex every day, even if you are in the middle of sex.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Paula Madrigal</cite>
        <p>Or, if you guys are engaging in sexual activity, and maybe all of a sudden someone decides I want to try it rough. You guys already started having sex. The other person can withdraw that consent, OK? So that's why it's active.</p>

        <p>What if someone's like, I want to have another person here. Now, let's have three people. You're already having sex.</p>

        <p>So if all of sudden, they're like, surprise, I have another person, you can be like, yeah, I didn't really sign up for that. I'm out of here, OK? Does that make a little bit more sense when we talk about checking in and the active process?</p>

        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>Those are carefully chosen examples. The vast majority of sexual assaults on college campuses occur between two people who know each other, and there's not always physical force. So Paula is trying to say, take the picture you have in your mind of a serial predator rapist. Put it to the side for a moment.</p>

        <p>Imagine instead a person who wakes up in the morning and wonders quietly to himself, she was into that, right? Yeah, she was into that. Imagine that person is wrong.</p>

        <p>The workshop was supposed to be 45 minutes. It's been an hour. Paula Madrigal is trying to wrap up.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Paula Madrigal</cite>
        <p>So how do you guys, then-- you guys are the experts-- how do you ask for consent?</p>

        <cite>Student 6</cite>
        <p>It doesn't sound right. It's like you're messing up the whole mood when you ask that.</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>It's been an hour, and the students in this room are still fixated on this question of the mood. I don't remember there being a whole lot of mood when it came to sex in college. I don't know, maybe you guys all had candlelit dorm rooms.</p>

        <p>But there is genuine panic behind that question. It's dismissed in a workshop about sexual assault because-- of course it is. We're talking about assault. You're talking about the mood. Those are two separate conversations.</p>

        <p>But these guys are trying to have just one conversation about everything, a conversation that takes into account consent but also all of their questions and anxieties when it comes to talking to a person they're sleeping with. It seems like that's a conversation they've never had.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Nagib Gonzalez</cite>
        <p>That is one of the hardest things ever, is to like, try to find out-- how would you say, find out what the other person wants?</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>This is Nagib Gonzalez, a college freshman in Buffalo. I know Nagib from previous reporting. He's lovely. And like every freshman at his school, he's been to a consent training in the last year.</p>

        <p>I feel like if we're going to lay the burden of changing the way we talk about sex at the feet of 18 year-olds, people who are already many years into learning weird and bad and confusing information, if that's our answer to reduce sexual assault, I wanted to know more about what these guys actually know and where they learned it.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Nagib Gonzalez</cite>
        <p>Men talk about women all the time. But I just thought, my roommate always talks to me about his favorite sex position. And then my other friends will tell me their favorite sex positions. And then we'll just talk about, oh, that's cool. Oh, I'll try that one day.</p>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>But that's men who are sleeping with women talking about what women like to other men.</p>

        <cite>Nagib Gonzalez</cite>
        <p>Yeah, so it's more like we'll decide what women do or don't like.</p>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>But when do you talk to women about what they like?</p>

        <cite>Nagib Gonzalez</cite>
        <p>Hmm, yeah, OK, it's definitely men talk to men about what women like. I feel like that's how it is. Even if you get told by a woman what she likes, you'll be like, oh, I knew that.</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>Lately Nagib's biggest source of information is his roommate, Elijah Leslie. He brought Elijah up a lot. Elijah says he first learned about the birds and bees from his cousin.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Elijah Leslie</cite>
        <p>Then you get older and you see Sports Illustrated. Then you see the Playboys. Then you see the porn.</p>

        <p>And then you see the Girls Gone Wild. And then you see those late night-- the Girls Gone Wild, the late-night commercials, and stuff like that. Like, 4:00 in the morning, Girls Gone Wild. I think that's when you start learning.</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>Elijah was not the first or the last person I interviewed who told me he learned about sex from porn. So Nagib is learning how to engage with women from other men who are learning from porn. That's like learning Chinese from a white American in Wyoming. You're missing some key primary source information.</p>

        <p>Every person I talk to who works on sexual assault prevention brought up one thing as particularly troubling about the way men learn about sex. And it wasn't porn. It was baseball-- that we talk about sex like it's baseball, getting a home run as a metaphor for sex.</p>

        <p>They said, think of how many bad lessons are built into that metaphor. You go first base, second base, third base. There's only one direction to move. And a home run is a win.</p>

        <p>Not to mention-- you're on opposing teams. It's competitive. And it's a sport that mostly only men play.</p>

        <p>Nagib Gonzalez is not attached to sex being like baseball or porn. Nagib just wants to be a good person. He wants to be good to people. He's looking for some guidance. Nagib is always looking for guidance. He solicits advice often.</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Nagib Gonzalez</cite>
        <p>This is an example. I remember my cousin telling me, yo, you got to kiss your girl's neck. I do it all the time. Oh, my girl loves it, and stuff like that. So then that's kind of where you learn.</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>Nagib, ever the careful student, kissed necks, every one of them. Another friend told him, women like it when you're funny. He tries to be that. But then Nagib had a girlfriend who told everybody he was a bad kisser. And someone told him, please stop kissing my neck. She thought it was gross. And he felt like, wait, do I know things, or do I not know things?</p>

        <section class="dialogue">
        <cite>Nagib Gonzalez</cite>
        <p>Definitely when you're younger, like you think of it more as like rules and steps to get laid. When you're younger, you think, like, oh, I have to do this step. I have to follow this step. So I have to kiss her in this certain place. Then I have to make out with her.</p>

        <p>And I have to, I don't know, touch her, like, I don't know, grab her butt or something. And then finally we get here.</p>

        <p>But it's not like that. It's not like that at all. It's less-- it's very-- it varies. It's different from person to person.</p>

        <p>It could be anything. I don't know. Girls vary. Not every girl will like something that you do. Every girl is different.</p>
        </section>

        <cite>Chana Joffe-Walt</cite>
        <p>Everyone is different. Girls vary. People vary. What if that was the first thing you learned about sex?</p>

        <p>What if, instead of starting at 18 years old with rape and moving backwards to teach consent, what if you just started with "people vary"? Because if you understand that, consent follows. You have to ask questions and talk about what you like and don't like. Otherwise, you'll never know. You may be with one of those neck people, and you may not.</p>
